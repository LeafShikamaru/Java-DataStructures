/**
 * Part I: Implement a class Clock whose getHours, getMinutes and
 * getTime methods return the current time at your location.
 * Return the time as a string.
 *
 * There are two ways to retrieve the current time as a String:
 *
 * 1) Before Java 8 use new Date().toString()
 * 2) With Java 8, you can use 3 classes in the java.time package:
 *    Instant, LocalDateTime and ZoneId. Here's how you do it:
 *    String timeString = LocalDateTime.ofInstant(Instant.now(),
 *                            ZoneId.systemDefault()).toString()
 *
 * With either method, you'll need to extract the hours and
 *   minutes as a substring.
 *
 *
 * Add an alarm feature to the Clock class.
 * When setAlarm(hours, minutes) is called, the clock
 * stores the alarm. When you call getTime, and the alarm
 * time has been reached or exceeded, return the time followed
 * by the string "Alarm" and clear the alarm.
